# clive
a small-ish initiative from the smethwick project. it's a platform for mobile phones (and mobile phones only, don't @ me about tablets they're just worse computers).

### how 2 run

ok you just gotta do a

```bash
# run a specific app
cargo run apps/clock

# build everything
cargo build
```

note that for the time being you need to be in the project root so druid can see the strings becuase i am NOT SMART.
